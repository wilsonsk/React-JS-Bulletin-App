<!-- 

    ** IMPORTANT: this index.html file has been modularized into a react app (for optimization) via the following...
        - 2 components: 
            1) parent component: Board -- placed in ./bulletin-board/src/Board.js and exported deafaul Board
            2) child component: Note -- placed in ./bulletin-board/src/Note.js and exported default Note
        - ReactDOM.render(): is placed in ./bulletin-board/src/index.js
        - style.css: has been placed in App.css
        - HOW TO RUN REACT APP:
            1. cd bulletin-board
            2. npm start
            3. hit the preview button above
        


    the component life cycle can make a lot of great enhancements to our code. We can do things like load data. We can add a little enhancements to our form fields. 
    Any time we need to do any sort of data loading or optimizations for speed, we can always tap into those component life cycle methods to make our applications even better.
