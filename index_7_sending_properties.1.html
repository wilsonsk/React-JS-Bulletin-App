<!-- JSX: javascript as XML -->
<!-- error at first < tag -->
<!-- error corrected via babel: transpiles (compiles) JSX to JS code (JSX, ES6 and beyond) -- which takes JSX and turns it in to createElement calls so browser can read easily 

    ex: <div>Hello World</div> >>> React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello World');
