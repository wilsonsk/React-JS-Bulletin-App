            //One of the most important concepts is state -- when a component's state data changes, the render function will be called again to re-render the change in state 
            //Checkbox is a component that is simply going to introduce state -- it has 2 states (checked, unchecked)
            //so let's add some react state -- the first method that we want to know about when it comes to our create class components is getInitialState
            //when our component renders, this will be the initial state of the application -- all we need to do is to define a statement, return, and then this object is going to contain checked
            //we will set the initial state to false -- so as soon as our application loads, the state of the checkbox should be false
            
            //next we have a custom function called, setState -- whenever handleCheck() is called, it's going to set the state to something different
            //setState is going to take in an object and we're going to reference the name of our state variable and then we'll say checked is not this.state.checked
            //so every time handleCheck is called, it's going to reverse this state, it'll toggle back and forth between two states

<!-- error at first < tag -->
<!-- error corrected via babel: transpiles (compiles) JSX to JS code (JSX, ES6 and beyond) -- which takes JSX and turns it in to createElement calls so browser can read easily 

    ex: <div>Hello World</div> >>> React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello World');
